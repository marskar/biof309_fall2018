Course Description
------------------

This course is designed for non-programmers, biologists, or those without specific knowledge of Python to learn how to program.
Week by week, we will slowly build up your skills and understanding of computer programming and the Python programming language.
There will be in-class demonstrations, using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/) and to a lesser extent [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io), and activities to be completed outside of class, using [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), for you to practice and learn at your own pace.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this course you should be able to:
1. Look at a task and determine if you can or should automate it
2. Create working Python programs
3. Understand the difference between Python object types (e.g. lists, dicts)
4. Perform data analysis and visualization with Python
5. Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and collaboration
6. Demonstrate your Python skills with a project

Communication
------------

**Before contacting us**, please check to see if your question has already been answered elsewhere, e.g. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

If you cannot find the answer, please make sure to ask your question thoughtfully (https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and provide everything needed to answer e.g. code, error message, dataset, etc.

In general, please use the [course Slack workspace](https://biof309.slack.com) to communicate with classmates and instructors. If you have a course-relevant question or something to share, [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com) is simply better than email. In case of personal/private question/concerns, please use [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com) direct message (DM).

In case of an emergency, please send a DM on [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com) *and* an email.

Logistics
---------

This is a one-semester course starting on the 13th of September 2018 and finishing on 13th of December 2018.

**Class Location: Rathskeller (Room B1A199C), Building 60, NIH Bethesda campus**

Attendance in class is strongly recommended; however, we realize other commitments may occasionally prevent attendance. If you miss a class, please review the materials available at the course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marskar/biof309_fall2018) and keep up with activities and homework.

NEW THIS SEMESTER! We will be piloting REMOTE ATTENDANCE and CLASS RECORDINGS via [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeet.me/biof309) and [WebEx](https://cbiit.webex.com/join/skarzynskimw). These two options are largely the same, you can pick whichever platform you prefer. Please do **NOT** use this as excuse to skip class and just watch the recorded lectures! This course is **NOT** a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC), it will feature a great deal of group work. Additionally, forming groups to complete the final project is highly encouraged! Remote attendance will work best if you can meet with classmates to work through exercises together. We will do our best to answers questions in the [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeet.me/biof309) and [WebEx](https://cbiit.webex.com/join/skarzynskimw) chat windows during class. We will also try to answer all questions on [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com), but please try to ask your questions during class, if at all possible.

Important FAES Fall 2018 semester dates:

* July 9 – September 7: Online Registration.
* September 10 – 28: Late Registration (10 dollar late fee per course applies).
* September 10: Classes begin.
* December 14: Classes end.

Recommended Books
-----------------
**There is no required textbook for this course.**

We do, however, highly recommend [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) and its companion text [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) by Jake Vanderplas. Both of these books are available free on [GitHub](https://github.com/) in Jupyter Notebook form. The code for [Python for Data Analysis](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) by Wes McKinney is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/) but the text is only available in the printed copy of the book. For maximum enjoyment, consider working through the relevant chapters before coming to class.

We will link to relevant online resources throughout the course.

If you would like additional material on the basics, the following resources may be useful:

* [Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/) by Martin Jones.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way (ebook freely available from the author)](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed A. Shaw; a [video course](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) is also available.
* [Think Python (ebook freely available from the author)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html) by Allen B. Downey.
* [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3 (ebook freely available from the author)](https://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php) by Charles Severance.
* [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) by Kenneth Reitz and Tanya Schlusser.
* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](www.automatetheboringstuff.com) by Al Sweigart.
